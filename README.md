### Installation

There are multiple ways you can get started with this! (at least on windows)

You can either run the portable version, or install it to your system!

- Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/sylviiu/ezytdl/releases) and download either the setup or portable version of the latest release
- And just run. Done!

-----

### Building / running from source

This one is also fairly simple :D

- Make sure you have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) (and NPM) installed
- Clone the repository using the git client, or download the ZIP of either the latest release / from source code and extract.
- Install the package dependencies using `npm i` in the terminal.
- If you want to run the program from source code, you can just use `npm start`.
- If you want to *build* a portable program, running `npm run dist` will package up the program into an executable. The resulting package will be found in a newly-created `dist` directory
